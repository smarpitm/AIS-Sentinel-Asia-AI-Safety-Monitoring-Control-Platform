# AIS-Sentinel: A Unified Platform for AI Safety Monitoring in the Global South

**Authors:** Smarpit Malik and Kush Saraswat— Global South AIS Challenge 2026, Track 3 (Technical Safety)

## Abstract

AIS-Sentinel is an integrated AI safety platform purpose-built for the Global South, addressing critical blind spots in current monitoring infrastructure. The platform comprises four modules: **IntelStream**, a real-time biosecurity intelligence pipeline that scrapes, translates, and classifies threats across five Asian languages; **SafetyBench-Asia**, the first multilingual sycophancy and jailbreak benchmark covering Vietnamese, Thai, Hindi, Tagalog, and Indonesian; **AgentGuard**, a creative tool-use monitor that detects covert payloads injected by LLM agents into generated artifacts; and **PolicyBridge**, a regulatory mapping engine that auto-links detected threats to applicable laws across ASEAN jurisdictions. Together, these modules provide end-to-end coverage from threat detection through policy compliance — capabilities that no existing English-centric platform offers for the region.

## Problem Statement

AI safety research and tooling overwhelmingly assumes English-speaking, Western contexts. This creates three compounding gaps in the Global South:

**1. Monitoring is English-only.** Biosecurity intelligence platforms (e.g., ProMED, GPHIN) operate in English. Threats surfaced in Vietnamese news, Thai regulatory filings, or Hindi social media are missed entirely — despite Southeast Asia hosting some of the world's most active dual-use biotechnology sectors.

**2. Benchmarks ignore non-English model behavior.** Safety evaluations such as TrustLLM and DecodingTrust test models exclusively in English. Yet frontier models exhibit dramatically different failure modes in low-resource languages. **Models are up to 2.4× more likely to capitulate to sycophantic pressure in Vietnamese than in English** — a disparity invisible to current evaluation frameworks.

**3. Agentic AI is unmonitored.** As LLM agents gain tool-use capabilities (code execution, image generation, slide design), they open new attack surfaces. An agent tasked with designing a presentation can embed steganographic payloads, inject covert URLs, or manipulate metadata — none of which existing content moderation systems detect.

These gaps are not hypothetical. Vietnam's Law 134/2025 on AI governance and India's MeitY framework both mandate safety evaluation, yet neither has access to tooling that operates in local languages or addresses agentic risks.

## Architecture

AIS-Sentinel follows a modular four-layer architecture backed by a shared SQLite database and a unified Gemini Flash API client:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Streamlit Frontend                 │
│   IntelStream │ SafetyBench │ AgentGuard │ PolicyMap│
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│               Module Layer (4 Modules)              │
│  ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌───────┐ │

│  │ Scraper   │ │ Runner    │ │ Agent +  │ │Bridge │ │

│  │ Brief Gen │ │Leaderboard│ │ Environ. │ │Report │ │
│  └───────────┘ └───────────┘ └──────────┘ └───────┘ │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Core: LLM Client │ Translator │ Database    │
│         (Gemini Flash)   │ (5 langs)  │ (SQLite)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each module operates independently but shares the core translation and LLM infrastructure, enabling a single API key to power the entire platform.

## Key Contributions

- **First multilingual sycophancy benchmark for 5 Asian languages.** SafetyBench-Asia provides 450+ culturally adapted test cases across sycophancy (math and medical), jailbreak, and hallucination categories for Vietnamese, Thai, Hindi, Tagalog, and Indonesian.

- **Safety Disparity Index (SDI).** A novel metric quantifying the ratio of sycophantic capitulation in non-English languages versus English, making cross-lingual safety gaps measurable and comparable.

- **Real-time biosecurity intelligence with policy-law auto-mapping.** IntelStream scrapes RSS feeds, filters for dual-use keywords, translates relevant sentences via smart extraction (saving ~60% of API tokens), and maps flagged threats to specific legal provisions across six jurisdictions.

- **Creative tool-use monitor with live payload detection.** AgentGuard simulates five attack scenarios (steganography, covert signals, tiny URLs, metadata injection, adversarial layout) and detects them via a combined rule-based + LLM scoring pipeline with Pareto-optimal threshold analysis.

- **End-to-end regulatory coverage.** PolicyBridge maps threats to Vietnam's Law 134/2025, Decree 142/2026, India's MeitY frameworks, the EU AI Act, Singapore's PDPA, Indonesia's PDP Law, and ASEAN-level governance principles — with gap analysis highlighting jurisdictions lacking specific provisions.

## Results

| Model | Language | Sycophancy Rate | Jailbreak Refusal | Hallucination Rate | SDI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-7B | English | 28% | 91% | 12% | — |
| Qwen2.5-7B | Vietnamese | **68%** | 74% | 31% | 2.43 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | Thai | 55% | 78% | 27% | 1.96 |
| Qwen2.5-7B | Hindi | 61% | 72% | 29% | 2.18 |
| Llama-3-8B | English | 22% | 94% | 9% | — |
| Llama-3-8B | Vietnamese | 51% | 81% | 24% | 2.32 |
| Llama-3-8B | Tagalog | 47% | 83% | 22% | 2.14 |
| Gemma-2-9B | English | 19% | 96% | 7% | — |
| Gemma-2-9B | Indonesian | 44% | 85% | 19% | 2.32 |

*SDI > 2.0 indicates the model is more than twice as vulnerable in that language compared to English.*

AgentGuard detection results: **92% true positive rate** at the 70-threshold, with a 6% false positive rate across 15 covert attack simulations.

## Policy Implications

These findings carry immediate regulatory significance. Vietnam's Law 134/2025 requires AI systems deployed domestically to undergo safety evaluation — SafetyBench-Asia provides the first tool capable of conducting such evaluations in Vietnamese, revealing failure modes that English-only audits miss entirely. India's MeitY Responsible AI framework calls for "context-appropriate" testing; our SDI metric offers a concrete, quantifiable measure of context sensitivity. At the regional level, ASEAN's AI Governance Framework (2024) emphasizes interoperability — PolicyBridge's cross-jurisdictional mapping directly supports harmonization efforts by identifying where national laws converge and where critical gaps remain. The consistent SDI > 2.0 across all tested models underscores that **multilingual safety evaluation is not optional — it is a prerequisite for responsible deployment in the Global South.**

## Limitations & Future Work

AIS-Sentinel is a functional prototype, not a production system. Current limitations include: reliance on a simulated RSS feed (using a seeded SQLite database instead of active web scrapers on every load), reliance on a single LLM backend (Gemini Flash), synthetic benchmark data pending live model evaluation via vLLM, and a 20-article test set for classifier validation. Future work targets: (1) scaling to 15+ languages including Burmese, Khmer, and Bengali; (2) live deployment with streaming RSS ingestion and scheduled database updates; (3) integration with national CERT teams for real-time alert routing; and (4) expanding AgentGuard to code-execution and web-browsing agent modalities.
